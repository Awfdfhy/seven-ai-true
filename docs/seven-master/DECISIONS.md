# Seven AI — Architecture Decision Log

## ADR-001 — GitHub is the Source of Truth
Status: Accepted
Decision: Multi-chat work is coordinated through repository documentation and code, not chat memory alone.

## ADR-002 — One Primary Subsystem per Specialist Chat
Status: Accepted
Decision: Specialist chats own focused domains to reduce context pollution and conflicting assumptions.

## ADR-003 — Shared Contracts Are Explicit
Status: Accepted
Decision: Cross-system interfaces are documented in INTEGRATION_CONTRACTS.md and cannot be silently changed.

## ADR-004 — Coding Before Self-Development
Status: Accepted
Decision: The Coding System must be robust and verified before autonomous/self-development features depend on it.

## ADR-005 — Verification Is Mandatory
Status: Accepted
Decision: No subsystem is marked complete from implementation alone; tests and regression evidence are required.
